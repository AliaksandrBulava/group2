#Principle of software development Task2
When calculating the volume of a complex figure, have to apply the KISS principle

KISS - keep it short and simple.
The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

I tried to implement my task as easy as possible.
